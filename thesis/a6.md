# 6. Self-Organized Collective Decision Making: The Weighted Voter Model

Random neighbor:
	agents first poll the opinion of neighboring agents within a limited interaction range, and then, they adopt a randomly picked opinion from this poll. (p.3)

Random walk:
	agents move straight for a defined amount of time; next they choose a new orientation and they resume a straight motion. (p.4)

Best average quality:
	requires longer times to discriminate between sites of similar qualities, while easier decision problems are solved with much smaller effort. (p.7)
	the accuracy of this model depends positively on the size of the swarm: big-ger swarms are more accurate. (p.7)
	the decision accuracy is defined by the exit probability which gives the probability of reaching a correct consensus. (p.7)
	shows high robustness to noisy quality of sites. (p.8)
