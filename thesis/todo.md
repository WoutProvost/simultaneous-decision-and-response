Exit probabilities:
	- An experiment is correct when the final preference for the red exit is >= 80%.
	- An experiment is incorrect when the final preference for the for the blue exit is >= 80%.
	- An experiment is inconclusive otherwise.
Cohesion speeds:
	- If an experiment is correct, the cohesion speed is the first time the preference for the red exit is >= 80%.
	- If an experiment is incorrect, the cohesion speed is the first time the preference for the blue exit is >= 80%.
	- If an experiment is inconclusive, the cohesion speed is infinity.
Non-symmetric:
	- Only show results for the correctly finished experiments.
	- n=30
Symmetric:
	- Show results for any conclusively finished experiments.
	- n=150
Influence of the reaction time threshold:
	- Only done for population ratio 0.5/0.5 with 100 random walk timesteps.
	- Doing this for the other configurations seemed redundant.
Correct response to the decision
	- Can be derived from comparing the decision and response charts.
Multiple fires:
	- Too high cohesion threshold.
	- See the different experiment set-ups.
Swarm robotics:
	- Broader discussion on swarm robotics and its properties.
	- With information referencing the articles.
	- Is this even necessary?
