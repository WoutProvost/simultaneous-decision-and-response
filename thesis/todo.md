Exit probabilities:
	- An experiment is correct when the final preference for the red exit is >= 80%.
	- An experiment is incorrect when the final preference for the for the blue exit is >= 80%.
	- An experiment is inconclusive otherwise.
Time to convergence:
	- If an experiment is correct, the cohesion speed is the first time the preference for the red exit is >= 80%.
	- If an experiment is incorrect, the cohesion speed is the first time the preference for the blue exit is >= 80%.
	- If an experiment is inconclusive, the cohesion speed is infinity.


Non-symmetric:
	- Only show results for the correctly finished experiments.
	- n=30
Symmetric:
	- Show results for any conclusively finished experiments.
	- n=150



Influence of the reaction time threshold:
	- Only done for population ratio 0.5/0.5 with 100 random walk timesteps.
	- Doing this for the other configurations seemed redundant.



Correct response to the decision
	- Can be derived from comparing the decision and response charts.


Swarm robotics:
	- Broader discussion on swarm robotics and its properties.
	- With information referencing the articles.
	- Is this even necessary?




Multiple fires:
	- Too high cohesion threshold.
	- See the different experiment set-ups.




Time to convergence: needs to reach that threshold and keep above that (allow difference of 5%)
No plot title

Maybe use pdf for pictures
Don't group all non-symmetric cases together because some are more difficult than others. More than 3 bars for each category.
Non-symmetric baseline only show correct
Generate difficult and non-diffucult charts and see if it is much different.

Maybe: Reaction percentage with different random walk.

Group charts more so they are more easily comparable (increase fonts).
Better organization.
Remove plot titles, maybe higher quality plots.

Related work in introduction or other chapter (articles): introduce work on collective decisoin making, value sensitive decisoin making (options with differnet qualities), there you can motive novelty of thesis and how my thesis is different because the quality changes (more challenging because it is challenging on the microscopic model, but doesn't change quality on macroscopic model), discuss voting model literature (same quality/symmetric as well), check works on collective response, work by Yara (Google scholary). (3 pages or so)

Maybe next Tuesday (4:30pm).
