- Use timesteps in thesis, not seconds.
- First the most critical fire is selected. Second the furthest exit is used from the selected fire. Both phases can be combined implicitely.
- For a single fire source, criticality isn't taken into account, since we know as a designer that we only have a single fire.
- Mail plot results to promotor.

# Data
- Analysis focus:
1) accuracy (exit probability, how many times you exit with correct solution)
2) speed of decision (how long it takes the robots to decide on an exit)
- Plots:
1) exit probabilities
2) correct response to decision
3) how long it takes the grippers to react
- Use a grouped bar plot for single fire and multiple fire.
- Maybe use other plots with other details.
