# TODO:
- Reaction strategy percentage threshold: 100%, 60% (only test for baseline)
- Use timesteps in thesis, not seconds. Mention the amount of timesteps per second.
- First the most critical fire is selected. Second the furthest exit is used from the selected fire. Both phases can be combined implicitely.
- For a single fire source, criticality isn't taken into account, since we know as a designer that we only have a single fire.
- Whatever you study in the analysis for sensor robots, do this for gripper robots as well.
- Analysis focus: accuracy (exit probability), speed of decision (how long it takes the robots to decide on an exit).
- Plots: exit probabilities, correct response to decision, how long it takes the grippers to react.
- Use a grouped bar plot for single fire and multiple fire.
- Mail plot results to promotor.
