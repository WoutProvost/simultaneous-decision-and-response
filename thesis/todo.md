# Experiments
- Try at least 3 values for each reaction strategy parameter (see which values are the most interesting)
- Try at least 3 population ratios, while keeping the total population size the same (see which values are the most interesting)
- When there's still some time left, try to change the random walk parameter
- When there's still some time left, try to change the random walk parameter, try to change the total population to 400

# Multiple sources
- position1="-7,-1.2" position2="0,1.2"
- The two distances from different sources to the same exit combined have a smaller difference than the two distances from different sources to the other exit combined
- Set of points A = fires, set of points B = exits. Determine which point in B is furthest/closest from the combination of points in A
