# TODO
- Discuss multiple fires
- Discuss time to convergence
- Discuss extra experiments

# Changes
- Time to convergence: needs to reach that threshold and keep above that (allow difference of 5%) + document change in latex text
- Don't group all non-symmetric cases together because some are more difficult than others. More than 3 bars for each category. Generate difficult and non-diffucult charts and see if it is much different. + document change in latex text

# Charts
- Remove charts titles
- Group charts more so they are more easily comparable
