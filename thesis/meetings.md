- Determine when to start the collective response so that it is most efficient
- Majority rule: the grippers use the data received from their sensing neighbours
- When working with data from neighbours, use a quorum to determine what to do
- Weighted balance between distance and temperature, since a fire that's not very hot but very close to one exit, might or might not be that bad
- Sensor move randomly to detect fires and aggregate
- Maybe use fire edge detection
- Start building edge, but abandon when not enough robots participate (use probabilities)
- Grippers also move to detect the edges being formed

- Distance method: measure the distance of the fire to the exits
- Fire spreading method: measure how fast the fire could reach the exits
- Determine which exit is closer to the center of mass of the swarm (only useful when the swarm is not uniformly divided)

- Migrate git repository from GitHub to UGent GitHub Enterprise
- Get access to the UGent cluster, email PHD student for credentials
- Implement mode with multiple fires before mode with dynamic fire
- Use RaB range of 1 meter
- Use 1 tile per robot width (= 5 tiles per meter)
- Try implementing the individual decision, changing decision and individual reaction mechanisms
- Try implementing some voting strategies
